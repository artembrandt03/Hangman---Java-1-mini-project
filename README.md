# Hangman Game - My First Java Project
This repository contains my first-ever Java project, a Hangman game developed during my introductory programming class at Dawson College. It represents my early exploration into Java programming, showcasing fundamental concepts and the thrill of creating an interactive console-based game.
## Concepts Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following key programming concepts:

- Variables and Data Types: Using strings, integers, and arrays.
- Control Structures: for and while loops for iterative processes and if-else statements for decision-making.
- Randomization: Using java.util.Random to select a random word.
- Input Handling: Using Scanner to accept user input and validate guesses.
- Arrays and Strings: Manipulating characters in a word and tracking guessed letters.
- Game Logic: Implementing conditions for winning, losing, and displaying the game state.
